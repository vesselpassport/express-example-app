To run:
* Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies
* Run `npm run start` or `yarn start` to start development server

The server will be hosted on http://localhost:5010. If you already have a build directory for the client (via `start` or `build` commands), visiting http://localhost:5010 will serve the client's build.
