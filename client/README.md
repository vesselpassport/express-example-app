To run:
* Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies
* Run `npm run start` or `yarn start` to create a hot-reloading build
* Start the Express server to serve this build

Note: The server isn't set up to hot reload changes to the client, so after updating the client, make sure to refresh to see the result!
